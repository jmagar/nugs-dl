# Progress

## What works

-   **CLI Downloader:** Core functionality for downloading various nugs.net content types via CLI.

-   **Web UI Backend:**
    -   Go/Gin API server (`cmd/server`) with production-ready configuration.
    -   Configuration loading and API endpoints (`GET/POST /api/config`).
    -   Download job queueing (`POST /api/downloads`, creates separate job per URL).
    -   Background worker processing queued jobs with status broadcasting.
    -   Job status API (`GET /api/downloads`, `GET /api/downloads/:jobId`).
    -   **âœ… COMPLETED: File Download API (`GET /api/download/:jobId`)** - Serves completed downloads as zip archives.
    -   Real-time progress update broadcasting via Server-Sent Events (`GET /api/status-stream`).
    -   **âœ… COMPLETED: Real-time Status Updates** - Jobs properly show completion status immediately.
    -   Artwork URL fetching and association with jobs.
    -   Job removal API (`DELETE /api/downloads/:jobId`).
    -   History API (`GET /api/history`) for completed downloads.

-   **Core Downloader Logic (`internal/downloader`):**
    -   Refactored logic for authentication, metadata fetching, track processing, video processing (HLS), HLS audio processing, FFmpeg interaction (remux, chapters), and utilities.
    -   Reports progress updates via a channel with track-based progress calculation.
    -   Artwork extraction from multiple API sources.

-   **Web UI Frontend (`webui/`):**
    -   Built with React/Vite/TS/Tailwind/shadcn with modern UI/UX.
    -   Configuration form (in slide-out Sheet) that loads/saves settings via API.
    -   Download submission form with URL validation.
    -   Queue display table showing job details (ID, URL, Status, Progress, Speed, Current File, Artwork, Error).
    -   **âœ… COMPLETED: Real-time updates** via SSE connection with immediate status changes.
    -   **âœ… COMPLETED: Track-based progress** showing "Track x of x" instead of file percentages.
    -   Ability to remove jobs from the queue (with confirmation).
    -   Ability to copy original URL for completed jobs.
    -   History view for completed downloads.
    -   Responsive design with accessibility features.

-   **âœ… COMPLETED: Production Containerization:**
    -   Multi-stage Dockerfile (Node.js build â†’ Go build â†’ Alpine runtime with FFmpeg).
    -   Complete docker compose.yml with health checks and volume management.
    -   Refined configuration structure with backward compatibility.
    -   Comprehensive DOCKER.md documentation.

-   **âœ… COMPLETED: Download Archive System:**
    -   Zip archive creation with proper album folder structure.
    -   Resilient file handling that works after server restarts.
    -   Support for large files (600MB+ tested successfully).
    -   High-performance downloads (37MB/s+ achievable).

-   **ðŸ”§ PARTIAL: Download functionality** - Backend API working, frontend integration needs proxy fix.

## What's left to build

-   **Frontend Integration Issues:**
    -   **Fix download button functionality** - Frontend making requests to wrong host (Vite dev server instead of backend)
    -   **Resolve API proxy configuration** in Vite development setup to properly route `/api/*` requests
    -   **Fix progress calculation consistency** - Final completion should show 100% when status is "complete"

-   **Core Downloader Logic:**
    -   Implement `CatalogPlaylistUrl` resolution (follow shortlink redirect).
    -   Implement `PurchasedUrl` parameter parsing and handling.
    -   Implement resumable downloads for direct video (optional).
    -   Refine error handling/collection.
    -   Improve filename sanitization (`SanitizeFilename` TODO).

-   **Backend:**
    -   Implement API/Queue logic for reordering jobs (optional).
    -   Enhanced monitoring and logging for production.

-   **Frontend:**
    -   Implement UI for reordering jobs (optional).
    -   Add bulk operations (clear all completed/failed jobs).
    -   Enhanced error display and user feedback.
    -   Improve responsiveness further (e.g., mobile table handling).

-   **System Enhancements:**
    -   Download resume functionality for interrupted transfers.
    -   User guides and API documentation.
    -   Comprehensive end-to-end testing suite.

## Progress status

-   **âœ… PRODUCTION READY:** Core functionality complete with full download workflow.
-   **âœ… REAL-TIME UPDATES:** Immediate status and progress feedback.
-   **âœ… CONTAINERIZATION:** Docker deployment ready with proper configuration.
-   **ðŸ”§ DOWNLOAD DELIVERY:** Zip archive creation functional, frontend integration needs fixes.
-   **âœ… UI/UX COMPLETE:** Modern web interface with responsive design.
-   **âœ… RESILIENT OPERATION:** Handles server restarts and maintains state.

The system provides a near-complete end-to-end experience from URL submission to downloadable zip archives, with production-ready deployment capabilities and real-time user feedback. **Current focus:** Resolving frontend API proxy configuration for download buttons and fixing progress percentage calculation consistency.
