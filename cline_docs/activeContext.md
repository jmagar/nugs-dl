# Active Context

## What you're working on now

Completed the Bivvy climb (wEb1) for the initial Web UI feature.

## Recent changes

-   Implemented the core Web UI structure using React, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui.
-   Created a Go backend API server using Gin.
-   Refactored the core Go download logic into an `internal/downloader` package.
-   Implemented API endpoints for configuration (`/api/config`).
-   Implemented API endpoints for managing a download queue (`POST /api/downloads`, `GET /api/downloads`, `GET /api/downloads/:jobId`, `DELETE /api/downloads/:jobId`).
-   Implemented a background worker to process the download queue.
-   Integrated real-time progress reporting from the downloader through the backend via Server-Sent Events (SSE) to the frontend (`/api/status-stream`).
-   Implemented artwork fetching and display.
-   Implemented job removal and URL sharing in the UI.
-   Refined UI layout (collapsible config moved to Sheet panel, added theme toggle, improved queue display with loading state, responsive columns, tooltips, progress text).
-   Resolved various build and runtime errors in both frontend and backend.

## Next steps

1.  Address remaining TODOs in the codebase (e.g., final downloader URL handlers, FFmpeg path detection, error handling improvements).
2.  Perform thorough end-to-end testing.
3.  Await further instructions from the user.
