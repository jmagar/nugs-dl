# Active Context

## What you're working on now

We are starting a Bivvy climb to create a web-based User Interface (UI) for the existing Go-based nugs.net downloader CLI tool.

## Recent changes

-   Initialized the Memory Bank by creating the `cline_docs` directory and populating `productContext.md`, `techContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `progress.md` based on the project's README and user input.

## Next steps

1.  Begin the Bivvy climb process for the Web UI feature.
2.  Define the Product Requirements Document (PRD) for the web UI.
